description=This mod adds the 1971 Chrysler New Yorker to the game for you to find and drive. Itâ€™s a four-door sedan with enough space for you and five of your friends to ride comfortably, albeit without a lot of speed. What it lacks in handling and acceleration, it makes up for in protection from the undead hordes. If you can find one of these and restore it, it will be a solid companion for any survivor group.|| https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3093198877
