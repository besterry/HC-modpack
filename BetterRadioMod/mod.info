description=This mod allows you to connect your ham radio to a wall outlet. That way you can keep on your radio for communication (works with MP Radio Patch).

description=Requirements: Lvl.1 in electrical aswell as 2 electronic scrap, 1 electronic wire and you need a screwdriver to craft it.

description=To convert to use grid power you need to have a ham radio in inventory. 
description=convert it and then place it somewhere with power (Power grid or generator both work).

description=Works with all three versions (civilian, military and makeshift) of the ham radio!

description=It is advised to remove the battery first before connecting to grid. Currently the mod doesn't check if there is a battery and it would be lost otherwise.

description=A small tip for those having trouble finding ham radios: Every emegency vehicle (firetruck, police car, ambulance) has a ham radio built in. Just open the hood and uninstall the radio. A screwdriver is needed for this.
