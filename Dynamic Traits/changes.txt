   - Wearing a Poncho divides the negative/positive effects by 2.
   - Wearing an Umbrella divides the negative/positive effects by 3.
   - Wearing both at the same time completely cancels the effects. (DTRainTraits increases even here, but without effects).

On Steam, Update April 29 2022:
A) Pluviophile trait no longer affect StressFromCigarettes (it fixes the stress peak when Smoker is present). File affected: DTByOtherConditions.lua
B) Pluviophile and Pluviophobia traits now detect all Ponchos (even if they are from mods) to reduce the effects. File affected: DTByOtherConditions.lua
C) Trait icons: 
   - Bloodlust and Prodigy icons were changed (Thanks Hea for the new icons).
   - Physically Active and Sedentary icons were recolored.
   - Flimsy and Frail icons were recolored.

On Steam, Update May 02 2022:
A) Code refactor and clean up for some functions (for optimization purposes only). Files affected: DTMainFile.lua, DTByOtherConditions.lua, DTByKills.lua, DTstaticTraits.lua, DTnewMechanics.lua, DTByMood.lua
B) traitsByMovingObjects function is now called in the EveryOneMinute (for optimization purposes only, more will be moved). File affected: DTMainFile.lua, DTByOtherConditions.lua
C) StressFromCigarettes will be set to 0 in the Pluviophile function. This fixes the stress peak generated by the addition of StressFromCigarettes to Stress. File affected DTByOtherConditions.lua

On Steam, Update May 14 2022:
A) Added loggers across the entire mod (monitoring the mod behaviour). The logs can be seen in the console.log. The functions that still runs based on OnPlayerUpdate event won't have logs yet.
   - Track if the functions are being properly executed (For example, if Anorexy is present, there are logs for the Anorexy functions).
   - Track of the ModData values changes (For example, if Smoker is present and the player doesn't smoke, that the ModData increases as expected).
B) Added a check for More Simple Traits. If detected active, then the DoTrait function from that mod will be called to avoid possible bugs with the Mutually Exclusives traits.
C) New Traits: Nervous Wreck and Melancholic. Files affected: DTByOtherConditions, DTMainCreationMethods, DTmodifiers.lua, DTMainFile.lua
   - Both are Dynamic Traits BUT will only affect who choosed them at the start (if you didn't pick them in the character creation then you won't ever have to deal with them).
   - Nervous Wreck can be treated with Betablockers, Melancholic can be treated with Antidepressants (one per day is enough to keep them always removed).
   - DTPillsBeta(Nervous Wreck) and DTPillsAntiDep(Melancholic) are the internal values for the traits. While the value is under or equals to 24 the traits are not present. Above 24 the traits are added. (It increases one per hour and decreases in 24 each time a pill is taken).
   - Having the traits will increase in 30% all the Stress and Unhappyness gains from others traits. Example: the Unhappyness and Stress generated by Alcoholic will be 30% higher if the traits are present.
   - Passively if the traits are present, each hour the unhappyness and stress will increase.
   - If no pills are taken the value will keep increasing up to 240 (10 days) so to remove the traits, 10 pills would be required.
D) Taken too many pills will generate overdose, which will generate poison. Files affected: DTMainFile.lua, DTByOtherConditions.lua
   - Each taken pill increases in 8 DTPillsOverdose. DTPillsOverdose will decrease in 1 each hour.
   - Every ten minutes the value of DTPillsOverdose is checked. If greater than 24, will generate poison in a chance of 1 in 7. The poison will be a random number generated between 0 and the current value of DTPillsOverdose. The traits that affect the poison in other traits affect here too.
E) Due to the Pills overdose, the fatigue reduction by taking vitamins was increased from 2 to 7 (to make them worth it).

On Steam, Update May 17 2022:
A) PIlls overdose threshold increased from 3 pills to 5 pills per day to be safe.

Not on Steam yet:
A) Traits by body conditions, traits by moods and traits by recipes functions were moved from OnPlayerUpdate to EveryOneMinte (optimization purposes). Files affected: DTMainFile.lua

   - The initialization for the different professions changed to match the new values. Security guard 75000, Burglar 50000 and Fire officer or Police officer 25000.
   - The increase of the value based on the profession and hour was also adapted to the new values.
E) Outdoorsman trait: Files affected: DTMainFile.lua, DTByOtherConditions.lua
   - Function now runs based on EveryOneMinute instead of OnPlayerUpdate.
   - The increase of the value was adapted to match the new behaviour.

F) Added description for EN, ES and RU for Nervous Wreck and Melancholic traits.
G) Smoker trait: Files affected: DTMain.lua, DTByOtherConditions.lua
