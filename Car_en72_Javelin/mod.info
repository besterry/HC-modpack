description=This is a 1972 AMC Javelin with the AMX performance package. It is a two-door four-seater with limited trunk space and moderate protection, but it is speedy and handles well, especially in inclement weather. Plus it looks hella cool. || https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3029146724
